Huffman Coding

It is a lossless data Compression algorithm.
(No data is lost during the decoding).
We assign variable length codes to input character, legth of which depends on 
frequency of the character
The variable-length codes assigned to input characters posses Prefix Property
which requires that there is no whole code word int the system that is a prefix
of any other code word in the system.
For example a code with code word 
{0, 11} contains the prefix property.
{0, 1, 11} does not contain the prefix property as 1 is the prefix of 11.
This property make sure that our data is uniquely decodable.


Approach

Huffman Tree
1.Create a leaf node for each unique charactefr and build a min heap of all 
leaf nodes.
2.Extract
